The first five tracks of this album familiarize you with a weird hominid creature known as Kid-A. A midway instrumental break provides a calming realization about life. And suddenly, a reassuring surge of energy carries the album’s finale, which puts the listener in front of their creator. Definitely the best exit music from any Radiohead work.";

    "In my opinion, this is the greatest album of the 90’s, and coincidentally the nail in the 90’s coffin. OK-Computer is a charismatic tour-guide who changes your perspective on life. It's the friend that helps you score your first sip of booze from your parents’ cabinet, forgetting to replace what was taken with water. OK starts with a person finding the cosmos in a car accident. Then transitions into a robotic public service announcement about a more productive life, not far off from our advertised lives. Finally, it leaves you with a tourist who feels that they are moving so fast through life that no one can understand their issues, forcing those around him to mutter, “Idiot, slow down.” Somethings will never change, and that’s the mania every cog in a given societal system finds themselves in. However, the universal mania displayed in OK Computer is tied to the late 90s. Radiohead was tired of what made them famous in the early 90's, but they hadn’t moved on from their humble beginnings. That’s why OK Computer is my number 3.";

//A Moon Shaped Pool

    "In 2016, Radiohead had a decision to make. Were they to join the godless entropy depicted in so much of their prior cannon? Sure each member had launched successful solo careers in soundtracks, DJ sets, and humanitarian work, but Radiohead was five years removed from an ill-received mood-less album. Or were they to create? They chose the latter. A Moon Shaped Pull is a heartbreaking but informative look on growing old, living in the present, and understanding the lack of communication between loved ones; with a few intergalactic experiences along the way. “True Love Waits”, one of my favorite acoustic Radiohead B-Sides from the OK-Computer days, is released in it’s final form, a melancholy echo-chamber whose only inhabitants are Thom Yorke and his reverberant organ. Why did Thom and co. choose to release this version that was so far mutated from the original and arguably more successful version? That’s one of the mysteries that we will never solve, and A Moon Shaaped Pool is reassuring us of that.";

This album is for the rebellious 25 year olds who have just woken up to the insanity of the world’s governments. When an album starts with a George Orwell ode and ends with a wolf at the door, one can’t help but feel helpless and agitated about the state of things. Sing along to Myxamitosis and tell me that you don’t feel sick to your stomach. Kind of an odd feeling to enjoy? Oh well, that’s Radiohead.";

//Amnesiac

    " While this is a fantastic album with some of my personal Radiohead favorites, it is the evil clone of Kid A. “Pyramid Song” can go head to head with virtually any slow Radiohead song and win, but it comes at a time in the album where I should be following the vivacious “Packed Like Sardines in a Tin Can”. A simple fix would be to just swap the track numbers of “Pyramid Song” and “I Might Be Wrong”, one of my favorite fast Radiohead songs! I think this is why Amnesiac falls so short of its sibling. It’s a mixed bag of B-Sides that don’t flow but still slap at an induvial level.Despite my complaints on the beginning of this album, “Knives Out” is one of the most inventive guitar tracks ever, and “Life in a Glasshouse” is Thom Yorke’s “Saint James Infirmary”. I still choose to sing the clarinet part on this track because it’s just so damn evil.";

But the Bends is still an amazing milestone for the troop. “Planet Telex” was the first hint that we might be listening to otherworldly visitors. “My Iron Lung” was the first time we heard one of the lives not so privileged in this world making fun of our first world struggles. And “Street Spirit Fade Out” reminds us that the only solace we have in this soulless world is to immerse ourselves in love.";

//Pablo Honey

    "I’ll be honest; my favorite early 90’s band is either the Red Hot Chili Peppers or PJ Harvey. I enjoy Pearl Jam’s Ten and Nirvana’s Nevermind, but they fall short of the others for me. I think early 90’s grunge improved so many aspects of 80’s hair metal, but it took away the fun. Being an anti-social free-thinking musician is great, but not when your new uniform is just as ugly as the last. Radiohead didn’t know what they were when they released Pablo Honey. How could they have? I don’t fault them for releasing Creep, it’s a great song, but Radiohead should have been doing things like Nick Cave at that time if they truly wanted a ground-breaking freshmen year. Pablo Honey can be a prequel, I’ve come to terms with that and don’t need to defend it further.";
